# reverse.c
*Explanation*:

1. *User Input*: The program prompts the user to enter a three-digit number.

2. *Number Reversal*: The program then reverses the digits of the entered three-digit number by repeatedly extracting the last digit using the modulo operator % and appending it to the reversedNum variable by multiplying it by 10 and adding the extracted digit. This process continues until all digits are reversed.

3. *Output*: After reversing the digits, the program displays the reversed number to the user. For example, if the user enters 456, the program will reverse it as 654 and output The reverse of the entered number is: 654.

4. *Sample Output*:
   - If the user enters 123, the program will reverse it as 321 and output The reverse of the entered number is: 321.

This program provides a simple and efficient way to reverse the digits of a three-digit number.
